## Debugging
Owlcat's wiki is slightly out of date, but still a good resource at https://github.com/spacehamster/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Debugging#debugging-with-visual-studio

Instructions below are updated for Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous Definitive Edition
1. To debug, download the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).  
2. Go https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive download and install version 2020.3.33f1 of the editor (this coincides with the Pathfinder WOTR Definitive Edition Unity update).
3. Navigate to [UnityFolder]\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\windowsstandalonesupport\Variations\win64_development_mono\ and copy UnityPlayer.dll and WinPixEventRuntime.dll to [GameDir] and overwrite it (I prefer to save the original UnityPlayer.dll as UnityPlayer.dll.original).
4. Use text editor open [GameDir]\Wrath_Data\boot.config and add:
```
wait-for-managed-debugger=1
player-connection-debug=1
```
5. Run [GameDir]/Wrath.exe, then you will see a dialog with message "You can attach a managed debugger now if you want"
6. Go to Visual Studio 2022, click menu Debug/Attach Unity Debugger A "Select Unity instance" dialog will show you some thing like..
```
Project              Machine              Type    Port       Information
<no name>            Your_PC_Name         Player  56593      PID:xxxx
```
7. Double click on it, then select ok on the debug dialog prompt to begin debugging.

Note: This project includes a post build option that will automatically update the default mod location in the Pathfinder WOTR mod folder.  To prevent automatically overwriting the existing mod, change the post build option.
